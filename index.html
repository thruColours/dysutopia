	The root of an HTML document is the <html> element.
	It will be the first tag you place on every page.
	Note that it is closed down the bottom of this file,
	on the last line. This means that everything else on
	the page is contained 'inside' it.

<html>
	<!--
		The <head> element contains meta data/general information
		about the HTML document. It must contain a <title> (the
		title of the document) and may contain other information.
		The content of the <head> will not be displayed on the page,
		the content of <title> is normally shown in the top of the
		browser or in the page's tab.

			The <link> tag is used to relate this HTML document to an external

			Should go in the <head> of the page.

	<!--
		The <body> element contains the content of an HTML document.
		It has to come after the <head> element and so should be the
		second element inside the <html> element.

		The content of the <body> is what is displayed on the web page.
